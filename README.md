# 🗞️ News Category Classification

Classify news articles into 4 categories — **World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech** — using NLP techniques and machine learning models.

## 🧠 Overview
This project uses the **AG News dataset** to build a text classification pipeline with:
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, XGBoost)
- Simple Neural Network built with TensorFlow/Keras
- WordCloud visualizations

## 🧰 Tech Stack
**Python, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, spaCy, matplotlib, seaborn**
